<p>Classical Conditioning follows a no-frills philosophy. 
This philosophy is, however, rooted in a few core priciples.
These principles carry over to all aspects of trianing, and will be incorperated in each individual plan.
As with any form of coaching, the athlete still has to put in the work. It is the coaches job to facilitate
and offer direction, the output is fully controlled by the athlete. At the end of the day what one puts into
trianing fully correlates with what they get out of it. 
</p>
<p>The principles are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Chase down fatigue</dt>
<dd>This is a very over-arching principle. Chasing down fatigue means starting with the the highest
intensity, lowest volume activity first, slowly moving into lower intensity, higher volume activities
as the session progresses. This is also how a few days of training in a row can be thought of.</dd>
<dt>Overall, its less important what you do, and more how you do it</dt>
<dd>This sounds like an odd principle coming from an online coaching service, but the principle has a deeper root.
Approach everthing with 100% focus, and at the end of the day that focus will be the biggest factor contributing to improvement.
</dd>
<dt>How you move is just as important as the strength you possess</dt>
<dd>Being able to utilize your full strength is the key to being the best climber you can be.
This is only achieved through optimal movement and connection to the wall.</dd>
